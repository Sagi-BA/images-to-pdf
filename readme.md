## How it works

The application reads the PDF file and processes the data. It utilizes OpenAI LLMs alongside Langchain to answer your questions. From the results, I used an appropriate response with the help of a LLM.

The application Streamlit creates the graphical user interface (GUI) and utilizes Langchain to interact with the LLM.

## Install dependencies

1. Do the following before installing the dependencies found in `requirements.txt` file because of current challenges installing `onnxruntime` through `pip install onnxruntime`.

   - For MacOS users, a workaround is to first install `onnxruntime` dependency for `chromadb` using:

   ```python
    conda install onnxruntime -c conda-forge
   ```

   See this [thread](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/11037) for additional help if needed.

   - For Windows users, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/bycloudai/InstallVSBuildToolsWindows?tab=readme-ov-file) to install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools. Be sure to follow through to the last step to set the environment variable path.

2. Install Tesseract [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) is an open source OCR or optical character recognition engine and command line program.

3. Now run this command to install dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Make sure you have [Streamlit installed](https://docs.streamlit.io/) CLI before running the application. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
streamlit run main.py
```
